### Dataset

This project is handling with MIMII audio dataset. You can download the full dataset in this [link](https://zenodo.org/records/3384388).

The full dataset is about 100GB. It you have no enough space in your device, you can check the file:

- `Code/cache_fan_fast`
-  `Code/cache_pump_fast`
-  `Code/cache_slider_fast`

They are already extracted feature data. 



### Train

Before running the train code, please follow after the `README.md` in the file `Code`. ([link](https://github.com/Joungbin-C/IAIA/tree/main/Project/Project1_2_PHM_Joungbin/Code))

After setup for venv, you can run the code to train DDAE, AD, and check the accuracy:

1. `Code/IAIA2_audio_fan.py`
2. `Code/IAIA2_audio_pump.py`
3. `Code/IAIA2_audio_slider.py`
